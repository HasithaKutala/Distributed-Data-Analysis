# Distributed-Data-Analysis
The goal of this project is to provide organizations with actionable insights to proactively mitigate talent loss and associated costs due to employee attrition.

Research Question:
The goal of the study is to identify parameters that can be utilized to forecast employee turnover, including workplace satisfaction, performance increases, travel time, work-life balance, and other pertinent variables. The attrition column, which indicates whether an employee has left the organization, would be the dependent variable in this study.
